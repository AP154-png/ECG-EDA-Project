# ðŸ«€ ECG EDA Project - MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset

This project presents an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of ECG signals using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset from Kaggle. The aim is to analyze the structure and characteristics of heartbeat signals recorded via **electrocardiogram (ECG)** and identify patterns across different types of heartbeats â€” without applying any machine learning models.

## Dataset Info

- **Source**: [MIT-BIH ECG Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shayanfazeli/heartbeat)
- **Files Used**:  
  - `mitbih_train.csv`  
  - `mitbih_test.csv`
- **Data Format**:
  - Each row contains 187 ECG time-series points + 1 class label
  - Labels represent different heartbeat types (Normal, Abnormal, etc.)

---

## Key Analysis Performed

- Plotting sample ECG signals by class
- Class distribution visualization
- Mean and standard deviation plots for each heartbeat type
- Signal heatmaps to visualize intensity variations
- t-SNE clustering for signal similarity exploration (no ML used!)

## Classes

| Label | Description                                |
|-------|--------------------------------------------|
| 0     | Normal beat                                |
| 1     | Supraventricular premature beat            |
| 2     | Premature ventricular contraction          |
| 3     | Fusion of ventricular and normal beat      |
| 4     | Unclassifiable beat                        |

## Bonus Visualizations

- âœ… ECG Heatmaps for class-level signal intensity
- âœ… Signal amplitude boxplots
- âœ… t-SNE projection for signal clustering
- âœ… Class-wise standard deviation analysis

These visualizations enhance understanding of signal structure, variability, and separability across different heartbeat types â€” which is critical in medical signal processing.
